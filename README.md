# DjangoModelsProject

This is my practise file including Pure Python and Html code.
In this file I practised for Model Inheritance concept, Model relationships and Django APi-Queryset
I create some models and show their interactions among them, as well render the data on html pages with the help of DTL(Djanog Template Language) technique.
My main focus in on Backend code nor to HTML but I feel that pretty cool to show data visually on front-end.
Hope you can use this for your practise purpose on initial level.
